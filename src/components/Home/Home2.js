            Our idea behind the project is to harness the power of the blockchain technology and integrate it into a chess game which gives players the opportunity to win Ether. By leveraging blockchain, every move is recorded in a transparent, immutable ledger. This ensures a fair and secure gaming experience. Within this chess game framework, users have the option to place a bet, engage in gameplay with an AI, and stand the chance to double their initial wager upon successful completion of the game. The bet will be recorded in the ledger as well, ensuring an undisputed transaction amount when the payouts happen.
